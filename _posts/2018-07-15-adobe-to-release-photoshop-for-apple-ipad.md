Adobe is apparently releasing Photoshop for iPad, Hurray? That's for you to decide!

According to the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-13/adobe-is-said-to-plan-photoshop-for-ipad-in-app-strategy-shift">report by Bloomberg</a></span> Adobe is releasing Photoshop for iPads at MAX creative conference in October. This means Apple can promote iPads to the designers for on fly editing on iPad Pro or other models. Does that mean you can replace a laptop with an iPad? You can but you will have to have a set workflow which doesn't require high technicalities involved.

This means if someone is working extremely in Adobe Cloud ecosystem you got it all set! But other editors, creators who like more versatility in their workflow still needs to stick to their laptops. The release date can be delayed as developer's needs good amount of time with testing period too.
<blockquote>"There’s a lot required to take a product as sophisticated and powerful as Photoshop and make that work on a modern device like the iPad. We need to bring our products into this cloud-first collaborative era." ,Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer of Creative Cloud</blockquote>

This is classic Craig laughing off negative media but he cannot reject the claims that the idea of iPad replacing laptops is still a far fetched idea, Not everyone has a rigid workflow which needs nothing but an iPad to achieve it's goals.

But the decision is for the consumers to make. Let us know what you think about it, whether you think it's a great idea or just a step towards a great idea?
