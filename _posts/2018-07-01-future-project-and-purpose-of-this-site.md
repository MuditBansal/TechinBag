I am putting a lot of backend efforts to make this site future proof. You should not be surprised if we discontinue WordPress also, as WordPress is a great tool with great compatibility but it also increases threats to privacy to the clients and visitors.


<h1>_Future.</h1>

This website is made to jot down tech ideas, new gadget's reviews and to be honest I have some really crazy stuff in mind too that I will launch when the time is right and when I have time for it. For now this site is the backbone of all the data required or learned for the product it will result in. It will not be a revolutionary site but it will be a little different approach to tech blogging, forums, discussions, community help, reaching audience will not be a run but finding audience which really like open - source and open minded technology reviews and ideals that result in really great learning environment.


<h1>_Privacy.</h1>

Privacy if visitors will be taken care of as sometimes asking a sensitive question without privacy is tough for some peeps.


<h1>_Community.</h1>

Till now the audience were tech enthusiasts who just use the end product - softwares, hardwares, etc. But now this site is for every aspect of technology to help you all and me learn!
<blockquote>Something learned is Something earned.</blockquote>
